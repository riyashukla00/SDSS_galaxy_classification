# SDSS_galaxy_classification
This project focuses on classifying celestial objects—specifically stars, galaxies, and quasars—using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). By leveraging features such as magnitudes in different photometric bands (u, g, r, i, z), right ascension, declination, and redshift, a machine learning model is trained to accurately identify the type of astronomical object. The Random Forest Classifier yielded high accuracy, demonstrating that machine learning can effectively automate and accelerate the process of stellar classification, which traditionally relies on manual analysis by astronomers. This approach contributes to the broader goal of efficient data-driven astronomy
